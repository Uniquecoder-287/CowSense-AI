"Build a clean, modern, premium-quality mobile app UI/UX for CowSense AI, a hardware + software system used for cow health monitoring and early disease prediction. The UI must be extremely simple, farmer-friendly, futuristic, and visually appealing. The entire design should use soft glassmorphism / neumorphism with a pastel color palette (sky blue, mint green, white, lavender, soft purple). Include smooth animations, rounded components, and minimalist icons.
